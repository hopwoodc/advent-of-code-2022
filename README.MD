This repository is my attempt at the advent of code challenge, 2022.

My goal with this challenge is to become familiar with C#.

When reasonable, I will code datastructures used in my solution myself, rather than the ones in the stdlib. This is to increase the amount and types of code I need to write.

For example, day 1 seems to benefit from a linked list, which is simple enough to implement.
